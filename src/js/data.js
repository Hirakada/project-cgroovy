    lyric: `It's gettin' darker on the road we're on, I know, I know
It's gettin' harder to believe in us, I know, I know
But we just left the car and I'm walkin' all alone, alone
I thought forever meant we'd die together, I don't know, don't know
Now you're just letting go
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray (now, you never pray)
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith
I know it's hard to stay in when you wanna walk away, away
And I forgive you every time you're leavin' me in vain, in vain
And I'm the one who's always fightin' for us, that's okay, okay
But I'm afraid we're at the point there's nothin' left to save, to save
And I can't find a way
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray (now, you never pray)
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith`

    lyric: `The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on

변하지 않아 절대
변하지 않아

Livin' as we are
We love, we laugh
어쩜 생각보다 더
쉬운 걸지도 몰라
What you waiting for?
Right here, 오지 않은 순간을 겁내지만
네가 찾는 건 아마 네 곁에 있는 것 같아
Just believe the way we live as we are

Hey, you know you got all you want
춤과 음악만이 전부였던
어린 나의 무대는 바뀌었대도
Huh, don't you worry about a thing
빈칸 속을
애써 채우려 하지 않아도 돼
이 순간을 천천히 즐겨

이 Seoul city의 빛
나의 손에 꼭 잡힐 때까지 더
기를 쓰고 달렸지
I can paint it bright for me
진짜 빛나는 건
네 눈을 멀게 하는 거

Put all your trust in me
Couldn't stop my train of thought
특별한 답을 찾지 않아도 돼
Me and you, we're good to go
To our heaven, we gotta go
Everything will be okay

Livin' as we are
We love, we laugh
어쩜 생각보다 더 (어쩜 생각보다 더)
쉬운 걸지도 몰라 (Oh)

네가 찾는 건 이미
네 곁에 있는 것 같아 (Ooh)

I just love the way you laugh, yeah, always
We just need to live as we are`

Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it, oh
So won't you send me your location

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you, oh
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

This the life of a vandal, masked up, and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me (ooh)
Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
