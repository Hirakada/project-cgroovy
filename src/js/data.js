    lyric: `It's gettin' darker on the road we're on, I know, I know
It's gettin' harder to believe in us, I know, I know
But we just left the car and I'm walkin' all alone, alone
I thought forever meant we'd die together, I don't know, don't know
Now you're just letting go
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray (now, you never pray)
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith
I know it's hard to stay in when you wanna walk away, away
And I forgive you every time you're leavin' me in vain, in vain
And I'm the one who's always fightin' for us, that's okay, okay
But I'm afraid we're at the point there's nothin' left to save, to save
And I can't find a way
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray (now, you never pray)
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith
I used to have you on your knees all night
But now, you never pray
And when you looked at me, you saw the light
But now, you've turned away (now, you've turned away)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You used to hold me in a holy place
But now, you've lost your faith`,

    lyric: `All night, up all night
All night, up all night
All night, up all night (whoo, whoo, whoo, damn)
Started thinking of me knocking around
Call me out, but don't leave the room
'Cause what I want and what I'm worried about came true
Hold the mirror a little nearer
And let me see the way I've been looking at you
'Cause what I want and what I worried about came true (oh, oh-oh)
Let's talk about dreams, let's talk about lies
Let's talk about all the things that keep us up all night
Let's talk about who, gotta talk about why
Let's talk about all the things that keep us up all night
All night, up all night (oh)
All night, up all night
Always had an automatic kind of panic
That I can't stop buryin' down
Talkin' sugars 'til I eat myself alive
I forgot what I, what I wanted
And the sun went down
I forgot what, what I wanted
Can turn this, turn this 'round?
Let's talk about dreams, let's talk about lies
Let's talk about all the things that keep us up all night
(What are they talkin' about?)
Let's talk about who (oh), gotta talk about why
Let's talk about all the things that keep us up all night
All night, up all night
All night, up all night (oh)
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na, na, na
Let's talk about dreams, let's talk about lies
(Gotta talk about) all the things that keep us up all night
Let's talk about who, gotta talk about why
Let's talk about all the things that keep us up all night
All night, up all night
All night (oh), up all night
All night, up all night
All night, up all night`,

    lyric: `Talk to me
You know it's all for you
You know it's all for you

Yeah, I feel my heart's beating quicker
두 발엔 때가 타버린 까만 sneakers
You know I've raced all this way
'Cause I wanna be a winner
더 중요한 게 뭔지 모르는 채
근데 어느새부턴가
잊은 것 같아 모두가 다
진정해 빨리 달려갈수록
주위는 쉽게 흐릿해져

이 Seoul city의 빛
나의 손에 꼭 잡힐 때까지 더
기를 쓰고 달렸지
I can paint it bright for me
진짜 빛나는 건
변하지 않아 절대
변하지 않아

Livin' as we are
We love, we laugh
어쩜 생각보다 더
쉬운 걸지도 몰라
What you waiting for?
Right here, 오지 않은 순간을 겁내지만
네가 찾는 건 아마 네 곁에 있는 것 같아
Just believe the way we live as we are

Hey, you know you got all you want
춤과 음악만이 전부였던
어린 나의 무대는 바뀌었대도
Huh, don't you worry about a thing
빈칸 속을
애써 채우려 하지 않아도 돼
이 순간을 천천히 즐겨

이 Seoul city의 빛
나의 손에 꼭 잡힐 때까지 더
기를 쓰고 달렸지
I can paint it bright for me
진짜 빛나는 건
네 눈을 멀게 하는 거
그런 게 아냐

Livin' as we are
We love, we laugh
어쩜 생각보다 더
쉬운 걸지도 몰라
What you waiting for?
Right here, 오지 않은 순간을 겁내지만
네가 찾는 건 아마 네 곁에 있는 것 같아
Just believe the way we live as we are

Put all your trust in me
Couldn't stop my train of thought
특별한 답을 찾지 않아도 돼
Me and you, we're good to go
To our heaven, we gotta go
Everything will be okay

Livin' as we are
We love, we laugh
어쩜 생각보다 더 (어쩜 생각보다 더)
쉬운 걸지도 몰라 (Oh)
What you waiting for?
Right here, 오지 않은 순간을 겁내지만
네가 찾는 건 이미
네 곁에 있는 것 같아 (Ooh)
Just believe the way we love and
I just love the way you laugh, yeah, always
We just need to live as we are`,
